Control Flow
------------

Remember if statements? Ruby has those too!

```Ruby
if x == 10
  print "x is ten"
end

```

This is the equivalent of:

```Objective-C
if(x == 10){
    NSLog(@"x is ten!");
}
```

Else works a bit different.
You cannot close the segment of code with ```end``` and use an else afterwards.
You must use the else in the same segment. So:

```Ruby
if x % 2 == 0
  puts "x is even"
else
  puts "x is odd"
end
```

### Loops

**NO!**

No. 

No.

You don't use loops in Ruby. Just... Don't.

#### But I need to use loops!

You probably don't

#### I REALLY do! Stop being mean!

...Okay, look. Read the [next chapter](../chapter_6/main.md)  and then we'll see, okay?
