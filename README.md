A Transition to Ruby
--------------------

For the first half of the year, we used Objective-C as the primary language for this club.
After considering some factors, I have decided to switch us to Ruby.
There are a few reasons for this:

1. Ruby is installable on far more platforms, and you can practice at home with windows.
2. Ruby is a language with strong Smalltalk influence, just like Obj-C, so transitioning will be easier than it otherwise could be.
3. I personally use Ruby for 90% of my shell scripting and web-related projects and have a fairly good understanding of the language.

With these factors in mind, let us get into the basics of the language.
